        Rock, Paper, Scissors (aka "Ro-Sham-Bo"; janken; "Bato, Bato, Pick"; and
        "Scissors, Paper, Stone") is a simple game: It is played around the world
        and is commonly used as a way of coming to decisions. The rules require
        that competing players use one hand to form one of three shapes at an
        agreed-upon time. The person that plays the strongest “object” is the
        winner of the game. It's that easy! Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple game
        that anybody can play and win. There is no intrinsic advantage to the
        stronger, older, or more experienced opponent.
